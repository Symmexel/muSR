# muSR
Simulation of μSR spectroscopy.

The two main goals of this project were to:
* Look at a recently developed technique to model the decohering effect of an infinite lattice exactly [[1]](#1).
* Attempt to explain the results of a 90° pulse in an μSR experiment with unexpected results.

While I have finished the project, over the next week or so, I plan to rewrite/refactor the original code to have a more ergonomic and flexible API.
