# muSR
Simulation of μSR spectroscopy.

The two most notable goals of this project were to:
* Look at a recently developed technique to model the decohering effect of an infinite lattice exactly [[1](#1)].
* Attempt to explain a μSR experiment performed by my supervisor involving a 90° pulse with unexpected results.

While I have finished the project, over the next week or so, I plan to rewrite/refactor the original code to have a more ergonomic and flexible API.
